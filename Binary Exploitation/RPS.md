## Approach
Looking at the script, I can see that the win detection is implemented using the strstr command, simply looking for the substring of the winning move in the player's input
~~~
  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
  } else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
  }
~~~
Thus by inputting the string "rockpaperscissors", I can give an input that always contain the winning move

Repeating this 5 times returns the flag.

Hence, flag is:  
picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_B69E01B8}

## Approach
1. Saw that you can input the length of your data, and thought that there is potential for a buffer overflow attack.
Didn't get anywhere with this.

2. Analyzing the script:
~~~
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
~~~
It is apparent that the server will return the flag when condition for entry_number is fulfilled.

Hence I headed to an online compiler with this statement to try and get an entry_number that will trigger the condition.

Immediately upon running the code, I noticed the condition is already fulfilled, meaning the default variable seems to be the trigger to the flag.


~~~
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long entry_number;
    char entry[4];
    
    printf(entry_number);

    if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
        printf("Test");
    }

    return 0;
}
~~~

Printing the default long variable value results in the following output  
Output:
~~~
ï¿½ï¿½1ï¿½Iï¿½ï¿½^Hï¿½ï¿½Hï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PTLï¿½ï¿½
~~~

Sending this key to the server returns the flag:  
picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_E0394EC0}
